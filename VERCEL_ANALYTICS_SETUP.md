2. **Component Added**: Analytics component has been integrated into `src/main.tsx`
3. **Build Tested**: Project builds successfully with analytics included

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Your Changes
Deploy your updated code to Vercel:
```bash

git commit -m "Add Vercel Analytics integration"
git push
```

### 2. Verify Analytics in Vercel Dashboard
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Navigate to your project: `maheep-mouli-portfolio.work`

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Details

The analytics component is now included in your main app entry point (`src/main.tsx`):

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <>
    <App />
    <Analytics />
  </>
);
```
