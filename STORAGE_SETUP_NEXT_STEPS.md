# Storage Setup - Next Steps

## ✅ **Database Success!**
Your database table has been created successfully! Now let's set up storage for image uploads.

## 📋 **Step 2: Set Up Storage Bucket**

### Create the Storage Bucket:
1. **Go to "Storage"** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Click "Create a new bucket"**
3. **Bucket name:** `portfolio-assets`
4. **Public bucket:** ✅ Check this box
5. **Click "Create bucket"**

### Add Storage Policies:
1. **Click on your `portfolio-assets` bucket**
2. **Go to "Policies" tab**
3. **Click "New Policy"** and add these 4 policies one by one:

#### Policy 1: Allow public read access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'portfolio-assets');
```

#### Policy 2: Allow authenticated users to upload
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'portfolio-assets' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

#### Policy 3: Allow authenticated users to update
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'portfolio-assets' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

#### Policy 4: Allow authenticated users to delete
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'portfolio-assets' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## 🧪 **Step 3: Test Everything**

### Test Your Application:
1. **Go to** http://localhost:5175
2. **Try creating a new project**
3. **Upload an image** - it should work perfectly now!

## ✅ **Expected Results:**

After completing storage setup, you should see:
- ✅ **No more 400 errors** in the console
- ✅ **Image uploads work** perfectly
- ✅ **Projects save to Supabase** successfully
- ✅ **Real-time sync** between localStorage and Supabase

## 🔍 **Console Logs to Expect:**

```
UnifiedService: Supabase query successful
UnifiedService: Data received: Array(6)
UnifiedService: Found projects in Supabase: 6
imageUploadService: Upload successful, public URL: [url]
```

## 🎉 **You're Almost Done!**

Just set up the storage bucket and policies, then your portfolio will be fully functional!
