  content: "\nWhy I Use Graph ML to Design Smarter Cities\n\nUnlocking Urban Intelligence through Machine Learning\n\nüìç Barcelona, Spain   |   üß† Computational Urbanism\n\n‚ñåINTRODUCTION\n\nIn a world where urban congestion has become a global challenge, traditional traffic solutions no longer suffice. Cities demand intelligent systems that adapt in real-time, respond to population surges, and predict infrastructural needs ahead of time.\n\nThat's where Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) enters. During my Master's thesis at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC), I developed FLOW‚ÄìSIGHT, a project that explores the potential of Graph ML to optimize urban traffic through predictive insights‚Äîmodeling, simulating, and visualizing traffic congestion across 8 global cities.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n\n‚ñåWHAT IS GRAPH ML?\n\nGraph ML is a type of machine learning built on networks or graphs‚Äîstructures made of nodes (like intersections) and edges (like roads). Unlike traditional ML, Graph ML captures the relationships between data points, making it ideal for urban mobility, infrastructure mapping, and transport optimization.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n\n‚ñåTHE CHALLENGE: CITIES THAT DON'T TALK\n\nMost cities still rely on:\n\nFixed-timing traffic lights\n\nHistoric congestion stats\n\nNon-dynamic urban planning tools\n\nThese approaches don't account for live factors such as weather, population density, public transport load, or air quality. This is where predictive models can change the game.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n\n‚ñåFLOW‚ÄìSIGHT: HOW IT WORKS\n\nStep 1 ‚Äî Data Fusion\n\nCollected 2 years of traffic, population, AQI, and weather data from 8 cities (e.g., London, Barcelona, Singapore, Mumbai).\n\nStep 2 ‚Äî Graph Construction\n\nConverted urban traffic networks into graph datasets with weighted edges based on speed, volume, and congestion.\n\nStep 3 ‚Äî Graph Model Training\n\nTrained a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict traffic bottlenecks and congestion build-up based on external triggers.\n\nStep 4 ‚Äî Dashboard Visualization\n\nBuilt a Streamlit dashboard with Kepler.gl to display projected congestion across geospatial basemaps. Live query insights powered by Gemini.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n\n‚ñåWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nüß† Better Decision-Making: Urban planners gain forecasted congestion heatmaps.\n\nüõ∞ Smart Cities: A foundation for AI-based, real-time traffic signal systems.\n\nüå± Sustainability: Reduced emissions by rerouting congestion.\n\nüõ† Scalability: Easily deployable in any city with access to basic open mobility data.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n\n‚ñåWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIn future iterations, I aim to integrate public transport prediction, emergency response simulation, and even drone mobility layers.\n\nThis blog is a space where I'll continue sharing behind-the-scenes tech workflows, design philosophies, and tools I use as a computational architect.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n\n‚ñåLET'S CONNECT\n\nIf you're an architect, urbanist, or data nerd passionate about shaping responsive cities, feel free to connect. I'm open to collaborations, freelance opportunities, or just sharing notes.\n\nüì© maheep.mouli.shashi@gmail.com   |   üåç Portfolio   |  ",
