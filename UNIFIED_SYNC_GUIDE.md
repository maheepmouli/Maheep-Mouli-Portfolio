# Unified Project Synchronization System

## Problem Solved

The original system had multiple services handling projects:
- `projectsService` (localStorage only)
- `dynamicProjectsService` (localStorage with translations)
- `supabaseProjectsService` (Supabase only)

This caused synchronization issues where:
1. Admin creates/edits projects but visitors don't see them immediately
2. Multiple storage systems were out of sync
3. Image uploads were limited to URL input only

## Solution: Unified Service

Created `unifiedProjectsService` that:

### ✅ **Immediate Synchronization**
- Saves to both Supabase AND localStorage simultaneously
- Triggers real-time update events for all components
- Visitors see changes immediately when admin makes updates

### ✅ **File Upload Support**
- **Cover Images**: Upload from computer instead of just URL
- **Project Images**: Drag & drop multiple images from computer
- Automatic image compression and optimization
- Support for JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP formats

### ✅ **Fallback System**
- Prioritizes Supabase for data persistence
- Falls back to localStorage if Supabase unavailable
- Maintains data integrity across all scenarios

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-time Updates**
```typescript
// When admin creates/edits project
await unifiedProjectsService.createProject(projectData);
// Automatically triggers events for all components
```

### 2. **File Upload for Cover Images**
```typescript
// In ProjectForm.tsx
const handleImageUpload = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const file = e.target.files?.[0];
  if (file) {
    setImageFile(file);
    // Upload to Supabase and update project
  }
};
```

### 3. **Multiple Image Upload**
```typescript
// In ImageManager.tsx
// Drag & drop or file picker for multiple images
// Automatic compression and optimization
```

## How It Works

### Admin Flow:
1. **Create Project**: Saves to Supabase + localStorage + triggers events
2. **Upload Images**: Compresses and uploads to Supabase storage
3. **Edit Project**: Updates both storage systems immediately
4. **Delete Project**: Removes from both systems

### Visitor Flow:
1. **Load Portfolio**: Gets data from unified service (Supabase priority)
2. **Real-time Updates**: Listens for custom events from admin actions
3. **Immediate Visibility**: Sees changes as soon as admin saves

## Event System

The unified service triggers these events for real-time updates:

```typescript
// Custom events for immediate updates
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('portfolio-updated', {
  detail: { projectId, action, imageUrl }
}));

// Storage events for localStorage changes
window.dispatchEvent(new StorageEvent('storage', {
  key: 'unified_portfolio_projects',
  newValue: localStorage.getItem('unified_portfolio_projects')
}));
```

## File Upload Features

### Cover Images:
- ✅ Upload from computer (primary method)
- ✅ URL input (optional fallback)
- ✅ Image preview with remove option
- ✅ Automatic upload to Supabase storage

### Project Images:
- ✅ Drag & drop multiple images
- ✅ File picker for multiple images
- ✅ Automatic image compression (max 800px)
- ✅ Support for JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- ✅ Size limit: 10MB per file, 20 images per project
- ✅ Image reordering and editing

## Migration

The system automatically migrates existing data:
- Supabase projects are prioritized
- localStorage data is used as fallback
- Sample data is provided if no projects exist

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility**: Admin changes appear instantly for visitors
2. **File Uploads**: No more URL-only image uploads
3. **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth with fallbacks
4. **Real-time Updates**: Custom event system ensures synchronization
5. **Better UX**: Drag & drop, image previews, compression

## Usage

### For Admins:
1. Go to `/portfolio/create` or edit existing project
2. Upload cover image from computer (not just URL)
3. Add multiple project images via drag & drop
4. Save - changes appear immediately for visitors

### For Visitors:
1. Visit portfolio page
2. See real-time updates when admin makes changes
3. No manual refresh needed

## Technical Details

- **Storage Key**: `unified_portfolio_projects`
- **Image Storage**: Supabase Storage bucket `portfolio-assets`
- **Compression**: Canvas-based compression to 800px max
- **Events**: Custom `portfolio-updated` events for real-time sync
- **Fallbacks**: localStorage → Supabase → Sample data

This unified system ensures that when you (as admin) post or edit a project, it immediately gets updated and is visible to users/visitors without any manual refresh needed.
