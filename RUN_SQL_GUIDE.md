# Run the Fixed SQL Script

## âœ… **SQL Issues Fixed**

I've fixed the SQL syntax errors by:
- Removing `IF NOT EXISTS` from policy creation (not supported in all PostgreSQL versions)
- Adding `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` statements to avoid conflicts
- Ensuring proper syntax for all statements

## ðŸ“‹ **Steps to Run:**

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `jetefprstmoewdfhhwqq`
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### 2. Run the Fixed Script
1. Copy the entire content from `supabase-setup.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **"Run"**

### 3. Expected Results
You should see:
- âœ… **No syntax errors** - All statements execute successfully
- âœ… **Policies created** - RLS policies for projects and storage
- âœ… **Storage bucket created** - `portfolio-assets` bucket
- âœ… **Test project inserted** - Sample project in the database

## ðŸ”§ **What the Script Does:**

1. **Creates the projects table** with proper schema
2. **Sets up RLS policies** for anonymous and authenticated users
3. **Creates storage bucket** for image uploads
4. **Sets up storage policies** for file uploads
5. **Inserts a test project** to verify everything works

## âœ… **After Running:**

1. **Restart your dev server** (if needed)
2. **Test creating a project** with image upload
3. **Check if the project appears** in your portfolio
4. **Verify image uploads work** from your computer

## ðŸš€ **You're Ready!**

Once the SQL runs successfully, your portfolio will work perfectly with:
- âœ… Direct image uploads from computer
- âœ… Real-time project updates
- âœ… Seamless localStorage + Supabase sync
- âœ… Professional appearance for visitors

**Run the SQL script now!** ðŸŽ‰
